# About me
My name is Francisco Daniel Davila. I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [GEMM Group](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg/gemm) at the University of Calgary, Calgary Canada.

# Background

From 2010 to 2015, I studied Biotechnological engineering at the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City. After receiving my BSc, I started my MSc studying yeast mutants and their effect on chronological lifespan in the [Genetic System Laboratory](https://cinvestav.mx/uga-langebio/investigacion/directorio-de-investigacion/Alexander-de-Luna-Fors) lead by Dr. Alexander de Luna at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV). Then, I moved to Germany where I started my doctoral work where I studied the community structure and microbial evolution of the gut microbiome across model organisms. During my post-graduate studies, I developed strong experimental and computational competencies to study complex microbial communities including molecular biology, NGS and Nanopore sequencing and development of computational pipelines for DNA data analysis.

In my Postdoctoral work, I am developing novel experimental and bioinformatic approaches to studying the Canadian Arctic Micobiome and their ecological and evolutionary responses to environment contamination and temperature rising. You can read more about my recent publication [here](https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.16688). I also collaborated with a Canadian startup to develop novel bioinformatics approaches to identify microbes correlated with different human diseases from gut and skin samples.
