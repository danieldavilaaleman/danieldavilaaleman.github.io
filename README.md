# About me
My name is Francisco Daniel Davila. I am a Postdoctoral researcher and computational biologist in the [GEMM Group](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg/gemm) at the University of Calgary, Canada.

# Research

From 2010 to 2015, I studied Biotechnological Engineering at the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City. After receiving my BSc, I embarked on my MSc, studying hundreds of yeast mutants and their chronological lifespan in the [Genetic System Biology Laboratory](https://cinvestav.mx/uga-langebio/investigacion/directorio-de-investigacion/Alexander-de-Luna-Fors) led by Dr. Alexander de Luna at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV). Then, I relocated to Germany to commence my doctoral work at the [Laboratory of Evolution and Experimental Biology of Ageing](https://www.leibniz-fli.de/research/research-groups/dario-r-valenzano) led by Prof. Dario Riccardo Valenzano at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing. My doctoral research focused on studied the community structure and microbial evolution of the gut microbiome across various model organisms. You can read more about my doctoral work [here](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007727). During my post-graduate studies, I developed strong experimental and computational skills, particularly in molecular biology, Next Generation and Nanopore sequencing, and developing computational pipelines for analyzing DNA data.

In my postdoctoral work, I am developing novel experimental and bioinformatic approaches to studying the Canadian Arctic microbiome and its ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental contamination and rising temperatures. You can read more about my recent publication [here](https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.16688). Additionally,I collaborated with a Canadian startup to develop novel bioinformatics methods to identify microbes associated with various human diseases from gut and skin microbiome samples.
